**_Pharmacophore Modelling: Drug Discovery Technique_**

Pharmacophore implies a compound's functional or structural capacity with a specific feature to a biological target **\[4].** Pharmacophore modelling is a crucial computational technique in drug discovery, particularly for developing anticancer agents. It identifies a molecule's essential features that guarantee optimal interactions with a specific biological target such as a protein or enzyme. The model can be a ligand-based or structure-based approach with Virtual Screening to identify compounds that match as potential therapeutic agents.

**_Important pharmacophore model feature types include;_** Hydrogen Bond Acceptor and Donor, Hydrophobic Areas, positively and negatively ionizable groups, aromatic groups and metal coordinating areas **\[5]**.

**_Ligand-Based Pharmacophore Modelling:_ **this method uses only ligand structures derived from structures of known active compounds **\[1, 8]**. A 3D ligand-based pharmacophore model searches for pharmacophores that match only the active compounds without the inactive ones and is used when no structural information on the macromolecular target is available **\[9]**. The model generating tools include; LigandScout, Discovery Studio, MOE, PHASE, PharmaGist, USRCAT, etc. This model was used to identify flavonoids with potential anti-Hepatitis B virus activities **\[10]**.

**_Structure-Based Pharmacophore <a id="_Hlk176279471"></a>_ **this model is based on a receptor-ligand complex interaction and its orientation **\[2]**as a strategy for combating cancer growth by identifying potential inhibitors for specific target drugs** \[1]**. This model can be generated with Discovery Studio’s interaction generation protocol or LigandScout. With Discovery Studio, a pharmacophore model is created based on four types of interaction (Aliphatic, aromatic, lipophilic, HB-acceptor and donor) of the functional group of the ligand and the active site of a protein on the interaction map. While with LigandScout, all chemical features involved in protein-ligand interaction are considered. The structure-based model has been used to discover CCR5 inhibitor (NSC13165) as cancer therapy for HIV-1 with less toxicity **\[5]**.  The choice of model depends on the data availability, data quality, computational resources and intended use of the generated pharmacophore model.  

**_Virtual Screening _**is a computational technique used in drug discovery to search large libraries of bioactive compounds to identify protein receptors or enzymes with potential drug targets. It is also divided into ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening. It validates the pharmacophore model by providing a focused search criterion based on known active compounds **\[10, 11]**.

**_APPLICATION:_ **it is used in the production of multi-target drugs and the design of non-resistance medicines **\[2]**, identifying lead compounds with known toxicity profiles and predicting side effects **\[6]. **Used by medicinal chemists to perform detailed conformational analyses and design ligands with improved binding affinities **\[7]**.

**_Conclusion: _**The**_ _**pharmacophore model is a computational technique essential for cancer drug discovery. It can be a ligand-based or structure-based approach, validated using virtual screening.
